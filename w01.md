# Top 10 List of Week 01

1. [Operating System Definition](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-operating-system-set-1/)<br>
Operating System is a program that acts as an interface between the user of a computer & the computer hardware.
The goal of Operating System is to execute user programs and make solving user problems easier.

2. [Virtual Machine](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/virtual-machines)<br>
A virtual machine is an emulation of a physical computer. They are often referred to as a guest while the physical machine they run on is referred to as the host.

3. [Virtual Memory](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/virtual-memory-in-operating-system/)<br>
Virtual Memory is a storage allocation scheme in which secondary memory can be addressed as though it were part of main memory
which creates the illusion of a very large main memory.

4. [Bash (shell)](https://www.mediacollege.com/linux/command/shell-command.html)<br>
Bash is a command processor that let us write commands. Prior to this, I already knew some basic bash commands
such as cd, ls, mkdir, rm, and mv. The new commands that I used during this week is history, alias, and cat.

5. [Open Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software)<br>
Open source is a broad software license that makes source code available to the general public with relaxed or non-existent restrictions on the use and modification of the code.

6. [Github page](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/)<br>
I learned how to make a github page. All I need to do is press the repository settings, and then choose a theme. Github will create the page for me.

7. [Operating system functions](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/functions-of-operating-system/)<br>
There are lots of important function in opearating system. Such as system security, controlling system performance, hardware management, etc.

8. [Hypervisor](https://www.vmware.com/topics/glossary/content/hypervisor)<br>
Hypervisor is a software that creates and runs virtual machine. Hypervisor is also known as Virtual Machine Monitor or VMM. Hypervisor offer a lot of mobility because we can move around the guest VM regardless of the host hardware. There are two types of hypervisor, type 1 (or bare metal) and type 2 (or hosted).

9. [Device driver](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/device-driver-and-its-purpose/)<br>
In the class, we discussed a bit about driver. Basically driver (device driver) is a software that used to communicate between hardware and operating system. There are two types of device driver: kernel-mode device driver, user-mode device driver.

10. [Vi](https://www.cs.colostate.edu/helpdocs/vi.html)<br>
Vi is a text editor that has two modes: command mode and insert mode. The commands that I used the most during this week is I to insert the text, d to delete, and :x to save and quit.
