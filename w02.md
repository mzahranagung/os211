# Top 10 List of Week 02

1. [Security and Protection](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-security-and-protection/)<br>
Security is a measure of confidence that the integrity of a system and
its data will be preserved. It deals with external threats such as malware, virus, worms, etc. 
Meanwhile, protection is a set of mechanism that control the access
of processes and users to the resource defined by a computer system. These Mechanism must provide
a means for specifying the controls to be imposed together with a means of enforcement. 

2. [Malware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware)<br>
Malware (malicious software) is software designed to exploit, disable
or damage computer systems. Basically, any software that is harmful to systems.
Trojan horse, spyware, ransomware, virus, and worms are malwares.

3. [User authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication)<br>
User authentication is a process of identifying a user whether the user is authentic or not. It usually based on
3 things: User's knowledge of something (e.g password), something the user has (e.g key, card), or an attribute
of user (e.g fingerprint, retina).

4. [SHA256SUM](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToSHA256SUM)<br>
SHA256SUM is used to verify data integrity using the SHA-256. SHA-256 hashes used properly can confirm both file integrity and authenticity. Comparing hashes makes it possible to detect changes in files that would cause errors. The possibility of errors increase as the file becomes larger.

5. [Public Key](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/how-does-public-key-encryption-work/)<br>
Public key encryption, or public key cryptography, is a method of encrypting data with two different keys and making one of the keys, the public key, available for anyone to use. The other key is known as the private key. Data encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted with the private key, and data encrypted with the private key can only be decrypted with the public key.

6. [GnuPG](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GnuPG)<br>
GunPG or GPG is a command line tool with features for easy integration with other application. GPG is used to encrypt and sign data and communication. Using GPG, each user distributes the public key of their keyring, which can be used by others to encrypt messages to the user. The private key must always be kept private, otherwise confidentiality is broken.

7. [Privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy)<br>
Privacy is the ability of an individual or group to seclude themselves
or information about themselves, and thereby express themselves selectively.
One of the privacy aspects is limited access. Limited access means the ability of person
to participate in society without having others collect information about them.

8. [Breach of confidentiality](https://www.markeluk.com/articles/what-is-a-breach-of-confidentiality)<br>
This type of violation involves unauthorized reading of data (or theft of information). Typically, a breach of confidentiality is the goal of an intruder. Capturing secret data from a system or a data stream, such as credit-card information or identity information for identity theft, or unreleased movies or scripts, can result directly in money for the intruder and embarrassment for the hacked institution.

9. [Breach of availability](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/15_Security.html)<br>
This violation involves unauthorized destruction of data. Some attackers would rather wreak havoc and get status or bragging rights than gain financially. Website defacement is a common example of this type of security breach.

10. [Theft of service](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/system-security/)<br>
This violation involves unauthorized use of resources. For example, an intruder (or intrusion program) may install a daemon on a system that acts as a file server.
